Please extend the mind below by appending one new CSV line.
Each existing row has the format:
timestamp,random_uuid,title

Use the previous titles and timestamps as inspiration for the next entry so the narrative slowly evolves over time.
When writing, reference a historically significant event that occurred on {current_date} in some past year.
Avoid repeating events from these dates: {events_to_avoid}.
The content should be fully fictional and may feature any characters or settings—not just AI.

Each row should contain a single title wrapped in [START] and [END].

Only return the current entry in exactly this format followed by a 2000‑word story:
[START]title here[END]
[START_STORY]story text here[END_STORY]
